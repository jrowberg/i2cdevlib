  // Section A
  // Description:
  //   This group of settings controls the filtering of the system
  //   when the data is greater than the baseline.  The setting used 
  //   allows the filter to act quickly and adjust for environmental changes. 
  //   Additionally, if calibration happens to take place while a touch occurs,
  //   the value will self adjust very quickly.  This auto-recovery or snap back
  //   provides repeated false negative for a touch detection. 
  // Variation:
  //   As the filter is sensitive to setting changes, it is recommended
  //   that users read AN3891 before changing the values. 
  //   In most cases these default values will work.

  I2Cdev::writeByte(m_devAddr, FDL_RISING,        0x00);

  // Section B
  // Description:
  //   This group of settings controls the filtering of the system 
  //   when the data is less than the baseline.  The settings slow down 
  //   the filter as the negative charge is in the same direction 
  //   as a touch.  By slowing down the filter, touch signals 
  //   are "rejected" by the baseline filter.  While at the same time
  //   long term environmental changes that occur slower than
  //   at a touch are accepted.  This low pass filter both allows 
  //   for touches to be detected properly while preventing false 
  //   positives by passing environmental changes through the filter.
  // Variation:
  //   As the filter is sensitive to setting changes, it is recommended 
  //   that users read AN3891 before changing the values.  
  //   In most cases these default values will work.

  // Section C
  // Description:
  //   The touch threshold registers set the minimum delta from the baseline
  //   when a touch is detected.  The value 0x0F (or 15 in decimal) is
  //   an estimate of the minimum value for touch.  Most electrodes will 
  //   work with this value even if they vary greatly in size and shape.  
  //   The value of 0x0A or 10 in the release threshold register allowed 
  //   for hysteresis in the touch detection.
  // Variation: 
  //   For very small electrodes, smaller values can be used and for 
  //   very large electrodes the reverse is true.  One easy method is 
  //   to view the deltas actually seen in a system and set the touch 
  //   at 80% and release at 70% of delta for good performance.

  // Section D
  // Description:
  //   There are three settings embedded in this register so it is 
  //   only necessary to pay attention to one.  The ESI controls 
  //   the sample rate of the device.  In the default, the setting
  //   used is 0x00 for 1ms sample rate.  Since the SFI is set to 00,
  //   resulting in 4 samples averaged, the response time will be 4 ms.
  // Variation:
  //   To save power, the 1 ms can be increased to 128 ms by increasing
  //   the setting to 0x07.  The values are base 2 exponential, thus 
  //   0x01 = 2ms, 0x02 = 4 ms; and so on to 0x07 = 128 ms.  Most of 
  //   the time, 0x04 results in the best compromise between power 
  //   consumption and response time.
  I2Cdev::writeByte(m_devAddr, FILTER_CONFIG, 0x04);

  // Section E
  // Description:
  //   This register controls the number of electrodes being enabled
  //   and the mode the device is in.  There are only two modes, 
  //   Standby (when the value is 0x00) and Run (when the value of 
  //   the lower bit is non-zero).  The default value shown enables 
  //   all 12 electrodes by writing decimal 12 or hex 0x0C to the register. 
  //   Typically other registers cannot be changed while the part is running, 
  //   so this register should always be written last.
  // Variation:
  //   During debug of a system, this register will change between 
  //   the number of electrodes and 0x00 every time a register needs 
  //   to change.  In a production system, this register will only need 
  //   to be written when the mode is changed from Standby to Run or vice versa.
  I2Cdev::writeByte(m_devAddr, ELECTRODE_CONFIG, 0x0C); 

  // Section F
  // Description:
  //   These are the settings used for the Auto Configuration.  They enable 
  //   AUTO-CONFIG and AUTO_RECONFIG.  In addition, they set the target
  //   rate for the baseline.  The upper limit is set to 190, the target 
  //   is set to 180 and the lower limit is set to 140.
  // Variation:
  //   In most cases these values will never need to be changed, but if
  //   a case arises, a full description is found in application note AN3889.
