To compile on a Raspberry Pi (1 or 2)
  1. install the bcm2835 library, see http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html
  2. enable i2c on your RPi , see https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c
  3. connect your i2c devices
  4. then from bash
      $ PATH_I2CDEVLIB=~/i2cdevlib/
      $ gcc -o ADXL345_example_1 ${PATH_I2CDEVLIB}RaspberryPi_bcm2835/ADXL345/examples/ADXL345_example_1.cpp \
         -I ${PATH_I2CDEVLIB}RaspberryPi_bcm2835/I2Cdev ${PATH_I2CDEVLIB}RaspberryPi_bcm2835/I2Cdev/I2Cdev.cpp \
         -I ${PATH_I2CDEVLIB}/Arduino/ADXL345/ ${PATH_I2CDEVLIB}/Arduino/ADXL345/ADXL345.cpp -l bcm2835 -l m
      $ sudo ./ADXL345_example_1
