Mosquitto for Windows
=====================

Mosquitto for Windows comes in two flavours, win32 or Cygwin. The win32 version is only
supported on Windows Vista or later.

In all cases, the dependencies are not provided in this installer and must be installed
separately in the case that they are not already available.


Capabilities
------------

The network support in Windows is severely limited. The broker is limited to approximately
1024 MQTT connections.


Websockets
----------

The broker executables provided in the installers do not have Websockets support enabled.
If you wish to have a version of the broker with Websockets support, you will need to compile
libwebsockets version v1.3-chrome37-firefox30 yourself and mosquitto version 1.4 yourself.

Please note that on Windows, libwebsockets limits connections to a maximum of 64 clients.

Windows Service
---------------

If all dependencies are installed prior to the installer being run, the broker can be
installed as a Windows service.

You can start/stop it from
 the control panel as well as running it as a normal
executable.

When running as a service, the configuration in mosquitto.conf in the
installation directory is used so modify this to your needs.
