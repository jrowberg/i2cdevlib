 * Topic: Threads

 *
 *	If your application uses threads you must use <mosquitto_threaded_set> to

/***************************************************
 * Important note
 * 
 * The following functions that deal with network operations will return
 * MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS on success, but this does not mean that the operation has
 * taken place. An attempt will be made to write the network data, but if the
 * socket is not available for writing at that time then the packet will not be
 * sent. To ensure the packet is sent, call mosquitto_loop() (which must also
 * be called to process incoming network data).
 * This is especially important when disconnecting a client that has a will. If
 * the broker does not receive the DISCONNECT command, it will assume that the
 * client has disconnected unexpectedly and send the will.

 *
 * An alternative approach is to use <mosquitto_loop_start> to run the client

 *
 * This calls select() to monitor the client network socket. If you want to

 * Use reconnect_delay parameter to change the delay between successive
 * reconnection attempts. You may also enable exponential backoff of the time
 * between reconnections by setting reconnect_exponential_backoff to true and
 * set an upper bound on the delay with reconnect_delay_max.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *	delay=2, delay_max=10, exponential_backoff=False
 *	Delays would be: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, ...

 *  reconnect_delay_max -           the maximum number of seconds to wait
 *                                  between reconnects.
